# toastystats
Scripts for scraping Archive of Our Own (AO3), Tumblr, Fanfiction.net (FFN), and Wattpad to gather fandom data.

These are all python scripts that will output CSV files containing
data about fanworks (plus some helper functions).  Anyone is welcome
to use them, so long as you share major improvements you make (e.g.,
if you want to modify them for a class project, go for it, but please
don't make a bunch of improvements/additions without sharing with
the community.)

For details on how to use AO3 scripts, see AO3/README.
These scripts include:
CASE 1: FINDING THE BIGGEST FANDOMS ON AO3
CASE 2: GETTING SUMMARY STATS FOR AO3 TAGS
CASE 3: TRACKING AO3 TAG ACTIVITY OVER TIME
CASE 4: TRACKING OVERALL AO3 ACTIVITY OVER TIME
CASE 5: FIND TOP SHIPS AND FANDOMS FOR A TAG 

For details on how to sample random fanworks from AO3, FFN, or
Wattpad, see Sampler/README.

For details on how to use Tumblr scripts, see Tumblr/TAGSTATS_README.
